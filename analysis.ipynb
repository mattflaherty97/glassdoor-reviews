    "In glassdoor_sentiment_analysis.ipynb, I ran a sentiment analysis on the data that I scraped from Glassdoor. In this notebook, I will analyze the sentiment and ratings towards a company over time, the accuracy of each method (using the rating to justify), and word frequency. Looking at the rating over time will allow me to determine if there were any peaks or valleys which could lead to further analysis as to why the peaks and valleys occured (ex. work from home order). Also, each method grades the text differently. Thus, I will use the rating to determine which sentiment method is most accurate for the text responses and I will also look at if there is a category of text response that is better at predicting the rating. Lastly, I will look at word frequencies which should give evidence to similarities among positive, negative, and neutral reviews.\n",

    "Looking at averages, both TextBlob and Vader seem to offer a pretty good indication of rating. The average rating of 3.23 shows that ratings are just above neutral and the TextBlob score is 0.19 which is just above 0 which was the neutral score for TextBlob. Vader's netural score ranged from \\[-0.5\\, 0.5\\] and its score is 0.37 which is on the upper end of neutral. Thus, I do not think that it matters which score is used for this analysis as both are accurate. However, personally, I feel like TextBlob is more intuitive because a positive score reflects a positive sentiment and negative score reflects a negative sentiment."

    "An overall analaysis of the market employer rating is great; however, I fear that with an abundance of reviews, then the average rating will be neutral. Therefore, I want to do a dive into a few (probably 5) companies to see what the rating trends are for a company. My first thought was to take the companies with the most reviews; however, it would be more interesting to analyze the company reviews who had the largest percent change in one year. Thus, we can look at the companies that had the highest percent change year-over-year. This way we have a better path to choose companies to look further into without just anlayzing the companies with the most reviews written. It will be better for storytelling. \"I saw these companies had the highest percent change, so I looked further into why this happened.\""
